## First Thoughts on Typescript

As a Typescript newbie, at first glance Typescript seemed mostly similar to Javascript. Though unlike Javascript, Typescript specifies variable types and performs a form of type checking which strictly does not allow a variable to change its type throughout the code. Another difference I noticed was the slight change in syntax. The only experience I have with Typescript was going through the tutorials in W3Schools, which were easy to navigate and understand. However, just like any other language, I would definitely benefit from a lot of practice with Typescript.

From what I have learned so far, Typescript is essentially a version of Javascript that has more features and prioritizes consistency. Typescript is readable, gives the programmer more control over variable scope which ensures consistency and easier debugging. For instance, when declaring a variable using ```let``` inside a block (like a for loop), it is only accessible within that block (or for loop). The variable cannot be changed outside of that block. Therefore, from the software engineering perspective, I think Typescript is a good programming language. 

## Coding Athletics
The practice Workout of the Days (WODs) we completed for ICS 314 were an effective means of familiarizing me with the expectations for the real WODs. Although the WODs may feel stressful knowing I am being timed, I think the WODs are important for us to train our critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Truthfully, I enjoy these types of hands-on activities because they are the most immersive and interactive way to learn. I find that I learn best through interactive activities such as the WODs. All in all, the WODs will help me refine my proficiency in coding and problem-solving which I hope will contribute to both my personal and professional development.
