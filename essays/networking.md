## Networking at the Tech Minds Meetup

The Tech Minds Meetup hosted by PACE allowed students like me interested in the tech and or business industry to network with tech professionals and entrepenuers. I had the opportunity to meet with multiple professionals with different backgrounds and specializations.

I had the opportunity to network with Brody Uehara, a software engineer at KwH Analytics, a climate insurance provider, who kindly took a picture with me. I asked them about whether AI is used often in their workplace and was told that it was. No matter the goal or focus, AI seems to be a valuable and widely used tool in the tech industry. I learned that many of the hands-on skills that they have learned and the skills we will acquire as students will be taught through internships, work, and projects. Thus, I was advised to pursue internship opportunities and work on projects that interested me.

I also networked with Kristian Lazo, a software engineer for VolunteerAlly, a local organization that helps connect people to volunteering opportunities, organizations, and events. Something that I thought was really interesting and inspiring was that VolunteerAlly originally started out as an ICS 314 final project! Their project eventually became an organization that is currently making an impact on our community.

## What I learned

Overall, the meetup was a very valuable experience providing me with a lot of insights into the tech industry and the workplace. I was really impressed by the stories and thankful for the advice that the professionals were able to share with me. Most imortantly, I learned that taking opportunities as they come and making connections are important for achieving success in the tech industry or in any career path in the future. I will keep this in mind throughout my academic journey in hopes of developing my skills and gaining experience.
