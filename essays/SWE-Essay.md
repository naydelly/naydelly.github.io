## Discovering My Passion

I developed my interests in computers and technology at an early age. I had the opportunity to further explore these interests when I took my first coding class in middle school. Since taking this class, I gained a particular interest in web and game development. I realized web and game development can serve as a creative outlet for self-expression and gives me the chance to create software that will positively impact the lives of others. From then on, I continued to take coding-related courses throughout my academic journey, specifically focusing on the basics of web design and development. Over time, I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and later, Python through classes and various online resources. 

I then decided to pursue a bachelors degree in Computer Science at UH MƒÅnoa in order to explore this passion of mine. Due to my involvement in a few projects, teams, and challenges during college, I have developed interests in more than just one branch of computer science. 

## My Goals for the Future

In regards to software engineering, my main aim is to contribute to and create impactful applications to improve lives, provide entertainment, and or enhance convenience. Although my interests may have changed, I still hope to dive into web and game development at some point in my career. 

One other goal I have is to develop a diverse set of skills in the computer science field. In order to achieve this, I hope to start mastering new programming languages such as Typescript, C#, and SQL. Learning new languages can be tricky, which is why I want to commit to prioritizing time management, using resources, and asking for help when I need it. I also hope that through the course, ICS 314: Software Engineering I, I will become comfortable with the software design process and working on team-based projects. Throughout the rest of my academic journey, I look forward to improving my understanding of the software development process and eventually developing a diverse set of skills, including my soft skills.

Although I do not know exactly what lies ahead for me in the future, I do know that taking as many opportunities as they come will allow me to cultivate my passion and continue doing what I love as a career.
