## First Thoughts on Typescript
  
As a Typescript newbie, at first glance Typescript seemed mostly similar to Javascript. Though unlike Javascript, Typescript specifies variable types and performs type checking which strictly does not allow a variable to change its type throughout the code. Another difference I noticed was the slight change in syntax. The only experience I have with Typescript was going through the tutorials in W3Schools, which were easy to navigate and understand. However, just like any other language, I would definitely benefit from a lot of practice with Typescript.

From what I have learned so far, Typescript is essentially a version of Javascript that has more features and prioritizes consistency. Typescript is readable and gives the programmer more control over variable scope which ensures consistency and easier debugging. For instance, when declaring a variable using ```let``` inside a block (like a for loop), it is only accessible within that block (or for loop). The variable cannot be changed outside of that block. Therefore, from the software engineering perspective, I think Typescript is a good programming language. 

## Coding Athletics
The practice Workout of the Days (WODs), daily coding challenges, we've completed so far for ICS 314: Software Engineering I were an effective way to familiarize myself with the expectations for the real WODs. Although the WODs may feel stressful knowing I am being timed while trying to produce the correct output, I think the WODs are important for us to train our critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Truthfully, I enjoy this type of learning method because it is the most immersive and effective way for me to learn. All in all, the WODs will help me refine my proficiency in coding and problem-solving which I hope will contribute to both my personal and professional development.
