My high school art club took on an exciting project: beautifying our school's recreation area. Our goal was to create an outdoor space where students could relax and study. My role was to create the design which was presented to the school board. Although we had to make some changes to our design and goals, we were able to start working on the beautification. Together, we created a mural on the fences. We decided to paint on plexiglass, a durable material, with acrylic paint, which adheres to the plexiglass well. We incorporated themes of nature in our paintings. To further beautify the area, we planted flowers and herbs such as mint along the fences.
